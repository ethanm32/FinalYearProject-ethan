PlayBack is be a website, which will be accessible to both desktop and mobile users. It will allow 
for users to login, have a profile with lists of their favourite songs/albums, search songs/albums and 
rate/review music. The website will use C# and will implement the MVC model.

This web application relies on three APIs. The main one of these being the Spotify API. This ensures 
that the user can search any song within the Spotify library. The fetch API is also especially important
as it allows for the data from the Spotify API to be contextualised and displayed to the user. The 
third API used is an API from GitHub that uses a json crawler to get data on the top 100 billboard 
songs.

This project is a  web application that allows users to rate, 
review and share their favourite songs/albums on their profile pages. It aims to be 
similar to movie websites like Letterboxd, but instead for music listeners.

The web application is deployed and hosted through Microsoft Azure.
